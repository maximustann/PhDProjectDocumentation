\begin{abstract}
  This document gives intructions to the experiments of Boxiong Tan's PH.D project -- \emph{Resource Allocation in Container-based Clouds (RAC)} and its extensions.
  Three main parts correspond to three main objectives in the thesis, 
  the experiments of the GA-based approaches for off-line \emph{RAC}, GP-based Approaches for On-line \emph{RAC},
  and EC for Multi-objective \emph{RAC}.
  In each experiment section, we introduces how to run the experiment codes and scripts, the algorithm implementations, and the dataset and how to generate them. With this document, one should able to repeat the experiments and to furhter develop these studies.
